# Product Roadmap

Nexion is rapidly evolving! We're committed to building the most powerful Web3 SSH management platform. Here are the features we're developing and planning. **Join now to enjoy early user pricing advantages**.

## 🚀 Development Vision

Our goal is to evolve Nexion from a simple SSH management tool into an **enterprise-grade decentralized server management platform**, providing secure, efficient, and economical solutions for individual developers and enterprise teams.

## 👥 Enterprise-Level Team Collaboration

### Team Account Upgrade

Upcoming team version features to make Nexion a true enterprise-grade tool:

```yaml
Team Version Core Features:
  Account Upgrade: One-click upgrade from personal user to team manager
  Permission System: Three-tier permission management (OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER)
  Cost Advantage: Save 95% compared to traditional enterprise tools
  Blockchain Storage: Configuration and permission records are immutable
```

### Group Management System

Flexible server configuration grouping to meet different business scenarios:

**Project-Dimension Grouping**
- Frontend server group: web-server, cdn-server, static-server
- Backend server group: api-server, db-server, cache-server
- Infrastructure group: monitoring, logging, backup-server

**Environment-Dimension Grouping**
- Development environment: Full access permissions, rapid iteration
- Testing environment: QA team primary workspace
- Production environment: Restricted access, only senior staff can operate

**Department-Dimension Grouping**
- Development team: Daily development server access
- Operations team: Infrastructure and monitoring servers
- Security team: Audit and compliance related servers
